# Digital-Clock-Project-

A digital clock in Python can be created using the tkinter module for the graphical user interface and the time module to fetch the current time. Here's a brief description of how it works:

The program initializes a window using tkinter, where the clock will be displayed. It then continuously updates the displayed time using the system clock. The time format usually follows HH:MM:SS AM/PM. The update is handled via a function that gets the current time and updates the label in the window every second using the after() method.
